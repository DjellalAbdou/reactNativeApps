# Pokemon Galery and Infos - Pokedex -

his repo represent my simple implementation with React native of a pokemon galery named pokedex, the project is tested only in android (because i dont have a mac for the moment :'( ).

this repo is a hobby project to implement a nice pokemon app using [Pokemon api](https://pokeapi.co/) .

the project is currently paused for a long time for educational reasons, but i plan on finishing it later and changing its current architecture to a better one.

## How does the app look like ?
